<h1>What does my positive test result mean?</h1>
<h3>To answer, you don't just need to know details on the test.<br>You need to know yourself well, too.</h3>
</div>
<div id="wrapper">
<div style="text-align:justify;line-height: 1.25em;">
<p>If you go in for a medical test, you're hoping for more clarity: you might have symptoms and want to know the disease behind them or be checking for something that runs in your family. But when it comes to regular screening tests, you may have no idea how likely you are to have the disease - and often it's fairly unlikely. Is it still worth checking?</p></div>

<div class="column-left">
<p>Let's say you're having a mammogram. A good estimate of breast cancer risk is age (although you can check your risk <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/bcrisktool/Default.aspx" target="_blank">here</a> and plug it into the visualization). Around 15 in 1000 women get breast cancer between ages 40 and 49.*</p> 
<p>Click below to see that in the graphic—the blue squares are the women out of 1000 who get breast cancer in that age range.</p>
<button onClick="window['disease_likelihood'] = .015; window['false_positive'] = 0; window['false_negative'] = 0; makegraph();">People with disease</button>
<p>There's always a chance that a screening test will miss evidence of having the disease—this is the false negative rate. Ideally, it's a low number. In this case, a mammogram will read negative for approximately 13% of people with breast cancer—although this number changes slightly based on age. Click below to see that in light blue.</p>
<button onClick="window['disease_likelihood'] = .015; window['false_positive'] = 0; window['false_negative'] = .133; makegraph();">Adding false negatives</button>
<p>But the real worry, especially for breast cancer, is the chance of getting a positive result when you don't have the disease. For a mammogram, it's approximately 9.5%—so you'd think you could be pretty sure a positive result means you really have the disease. But let's look:</p>
<button onClick="window['disease_likelihood'] = .015; window['false_positive'] = .095; window['false_negative'] = .133; makegraph();">Mammogram test results</button>
<p>
All the dark gray that's appeared is the number of people with that risk who will get a positive result even though they don't have the disease—it far outstrips the true positive results. Even though it's much more likely to get a positive when you do have the disease than when you don't, there are so many more people without the disease that the lower rate of false positives adds up.

<p>"This is a good test if you test negative, but it's a horrible positive prediction value," says Dr. Scott Zeger, a professor of biostatistics at Johns Hopkins University. "If you test positive, you probably don't have the disease."</p>
<p>But as the years go by and your risk increases, or if you find out that you have a strong risk factor, the probability of a true positive result increases.</p>
<button onClick="window['disease_likelihood'] = .039; window['false_positive'] = .095; window['false_negative'] = .133; makegraph();">Mammogram test results age 60</button>
<p>The more sensitive a test is, so the lower the false positive rate, the fewer false alarms you'll get—but the factor that has the greatest effect is your own risk.</p> 
<p>According to Dr. Julie Kaplan, a geneticist at University of Maryland, doctors generally only advise screening tests when there's some kind of follow-up action. When she administers screening tests to newborns, for instance, it's vital to catch certain vitamin deficiencies, and she will assign supplements even before seeing follow-up results. "Usually, the conditions we screen for have treatments," she says. "There is the ability to treat or manage it."</p>
<p>Ultimately, with mammograms, a "positive" leads to a follow-up test to try and find more evidence of cancer. Because of the high false-positive rate, and the chance of overdiagnosing what the test finds, the US Preventative Services Task Force does not recommend getting regular mammograms until age 50 unless you have some higher known risk.</p>
<p>Try changing the risk of having the disease  yourself to the left. It has a big effect!</p>

<div style="float:left;text-align:justify;line-height: 1.25em;">
<a><p>You can think of lots of different diagnostic tests this same way; for instance, this quick HIV test follows a similar pattern of false positives if you're in a very low-risk population, even though it has an 0.2% false positive rate. Use these buttons and scroll up to see
<button style="display:inline" onClick="window['disease_likelihood'] = .001; window['false_positive'] = .002; window['false_negative'] = .007; makegraph();">HIV test with lower risk</button>/<button style="display:inline;" onClick="window['disease_likelihood'] = .01; window['false_positive'] = .002; window['false_negative'] = .007; makegraph();">HIV test with higher risk</button></p>

<p>To calculate the false positive and false negative rates at the bottom of the visualization, I used the <b>sensitivity</b> and <b>specificity</b> of a mammogram, found <a href="http://breastscreening.cancer.gov/statistics/benchmarks/screening/2009/table7.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Sensitivity and specificity are two values commonly used to quantify how effective medical tests are—to plug in your own tests look up the sensitivity and specificity values online and then enter 1 - sensitivity for false negative and 1 - specificity for false positive. Remember that the calculation can only be as accurate as the data you have—so be sure to get a good idea of your risk. Good luck!
